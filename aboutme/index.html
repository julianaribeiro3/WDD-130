    <h2>Juliana Ribeiro</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Juliana Ribeiro. I'm from Brazil, but I'm currently living in Utah. I have been married to a wonderful husband for 23 years, and we have three daughters. My oldest is 20, she is serving a mission, and my other two daughters are in High School.</p>
    <p>My major is Applied Technology. Recently I changed position in my work, and I had to start coding HTML, which was a challenge for me. I've been able to learn searching on google, but I decided to take classes to improve my skills.</p>
    <p>I love spending time with my family, watching movies, and doing small projects in the house. I'm excited to learn with all of you!</p>
