      <h4>Our Family Hotel</h4>
      <p>Ribeiros Inn is synonymous with family time. Not a classic hotel, not a place for everyone. Our home will be your home from home. Enjoy our beautiful space where we can create wonderful memories.</p>
      <p>We are located in Highland, Utah, a beautiful place surrounded by mountains, making it the perfect place for rest and relaxation.</p>
      <p>With plenty of room for yourselves in both your suite and the entire house. Our rooms are equipped with air-conditioning, heated shower, queen beds, television, and impeccable cleanliness. We offer a cozy suite with a queen and a twin bed or a bedroom with a queen bed.</p>

      <h3>Things to Do</h3>
      <p><strong>Salt Lake City</strong></p>
      <p>One of the oldest structures that yet stands in Salt Lake is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Temple. The temple was put up in the 19th century as one of the largest in the city. It has a beautiful tour.</p>
      <p>The State Capitol and the Mormon Tabernacle could also interest you sometime during the day</p>

      <p><strong>Skiing in Park City</strong></p>
      <p>Skiing down the Park City Mountain in Utah could be one of the cool things to do for your adventure. Three hundred thirty available trails allow appropriate fun according to skiing abilities or level.</p>

      <p><strong>Lake Powell</strong></p>
      <p>Despite its name, Lake Powell is a human-made reservoir in Utah rather than a lake. Its vast size makes it possible to indulge in various activities, such as boating, kayaking, wakeboarding, and swimming, among more.</p>

      <p><strong>Homestead Crater</strong></p>
      <p>After the Wasatch Mountain’s melting snow tore into the earth’s interior, the heated water formed a volcano-shaped limestone deposit. This geothermal spring is a top destination. We can take a dip or soak in the warm water.</p>
